# Pharmacy Website Project

Welcome to the Pharmacy Website Project! This project aims to develop a comprehensive website for a pharmacy, integrating features like product showcasing, lab test booking, and more. We've utilized the latest technologies and styles to code the project in the most advanced yet simple manner.

## Project Structure

- **Pharmacy Shop/**
  - **images/**: Contains all the images used in the project.
  - **css/**: Holds the CSS files for styling.
    - **ads.css**: Styles for the animated banner.
    - **styles.css**: Main styling rules for the website.
    - **lab_test_styles.css**: Additional styles for the lab test booking form.
  - **home.html**: Homepage of the pharmacy website.
  - **lab_test.html**: Form for booking lab tests.
- **screenshot/**: Screenshots of the website (outside the project folder in the main branch).

## Features

1. **Header and Footer**: The website includes a centered header with the pharmacy's name and a copyright footer.

2. **Navigation Bar**: A horizontal navigation bar allows easy access to different sections of the website, such as Home, Our Medicines (with dropdown), Health Care (with dropdown), and Lab Test booking.

3. **Scrolling Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page while scrolling for easy navigation.

4. **Animated Banner**: The homepage features an animated banner showcasing offers or important information using images provided in the project.

5. **Product Sections**: Sample sections for Covid Care and Diabetes Care display products with details like name, image, price, discounted price, and an option to add to cart.

6. **Interactive Product Cards**: Product cards change background and border colors upon clicking the "Add to Cart" button, and they slightly increase in size when hovered over.

7. **Lab Test Booking Form**: Clicking on the Lab Test option in the navigation bar opens a form for booking lab tests. The form includes fields for patient contact details, test type selection, appointment scheduling, and an option for hard copy reports.

8. **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Usage

To access the website, simply open the `home.html` file in a web browser.

To test the form, access the `lab_test.html` file or click the navigation bar link in the `home.html` page labelled as 'Lab Test'.
